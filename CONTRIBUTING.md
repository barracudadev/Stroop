## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests for specific package
pnpm --filter @stroop/api test

# Run with coverage
pnpm test --coverage
```

### 4. Lint and Format

```bash
# Lint all packages
pnpm lint

# Fix linting issues
pnpm lint:fix

# Format code
pnpm format
```

### 5. Commit Changes

Use conventional commit messages:

```
feat: add new feature
fix: resolve bug in transaction processing
docs: update API documentation
style: format code with prettier
refactor: improve database query performance
test: add unit tests for account service
chore: update dependencies
```

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Open a Pull Request with a clear description of your changes.

## 📋 Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Provide explicit types for all functions
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use proper generic types

### Code Style

- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies

### Documentation

- Update README for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document GraphQL schema changes
- Include examples in API documentation

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

```typescript
// Example test
import { describe, it, expect } from '@jest/globals'
import { formatAsset } from '../utils/stellar'

describe('formatAsset', () => {
  it('should format native asset correctly', () => {
    const asset = { asset_type: 'native' }
    expect(formatAsset(asset)).toBe('XLM')
  })

  it('should format credit asset correctly', () => {
    const asset = {
      asset_type: 'credit_alphanum4',
      asset_code: 'USD',
      asset_issuer: 'GB...'
    }
    expect(formatAsset(asset)).toBe('USD:GB...')
  })
})
```

### Integration Tests

- Test database interactions
- Test API endpoints
- Test real-time subscriptions
- Use test database fixtures

### E2E Tests

- Test user workflows
- Test real-time updates
- Use Playwright or Cypress

## 📦 Package Development

### Adding New Dependencies

```bash
# Add to specific package
pnpm --filter @stroop/api add graphql

# Add to all packages
pnpm add -w typescript

# Add dev dependency
pnpm --filter @stroop/frontend add -D @types/react
```

### Building Packages

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Build specific package
pnpm --filter @stroop/shared build
```

## 🔧 Database Changes

### Schema Updates

1. Create a new migration:
   ```bash
   pnpm db:migrate:create describe_your_change
   ```
2. Implement `exports.up` and `exports.down` in `packages/indexer/migrations/`
3. Update `packages/indexer/src/database/schema.sql` as a reference snapshot (optional)
4. Update TypeScript types in shared package when needed
5. Test migrate up/down locally before opening a PR

See `docs/database-migrations.md` for rollback, CI, and production guidance.

### Testing Database Changes

```bash
# Reset database
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Run migrations
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:migrate:down
pnpm db:migrate
```

## 👥 Code Ownership

Each service area has a designated owning team. GitHub automatically requests their review via [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS) whenever a PR touches their files.

See [`docs/code-ownership.md`](docs/code-ownership.md) for the full ownership table, per-area acceptance criteria, and escalation guidelines.

## Issue taxonomy

Use the labels, areas, and title conventions in [`docs/contributor-issue-taxonomy.md`](docs/contributor-issue-taxonomy.md) when filing or triaging issues. Every new feature request starts with `needs-triage` and must identify affected monorepo areas.

## 📦 Dependency Updates

Third-party packages are kept current via Dependabot, which opens grouped PRs every Monday at 06:00 UTC. Security advisories are handled immediately regardless of the weekly schedule.

Every Dependabot PR automatically triggers the **Dependency Update Verify** workflow (`.github/workflows/dependency-update-verify.yml`), which runs the full lint, type-check, build, and unit test suite and posts a consolidated pass/fail comment on the PR. Reviewers should wait for that comment to be green before merging.

See [`docs/dependency-management.md`](docs/dependency-management.md) for the full update policy, review checklist, and instructions for manual updates.

## 🤝 Community Guidelines

### Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Provide constructive feedback
- Help others learn and grow

### Getting Help

- Ask questions in GitHub Discussions
- Join our Discord community
- Check existing issues before creating new ones

## 🏆 Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:

- README contributors section
- Release notes
- Community highlights

## 📋 Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] New functionality is tested
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Commit messages are conventional
- [ ] No sensitive data is committed
- [ ] PR description is clear and detailed

## 🐛 Bug Reports

Use the **Bug Report** template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`) when opening a bug. The template prompts for reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behaviour, environment details, and relevant logs. Apply the `needs-triage` label manually if it is not added automatically.

See [`docs/issue-triage-and-planning.md`](docs/issue-triage-and-planning.md) for how bugs move from filing through triage and into the sprint.

## 💡 Feature Requests

Use the **Feature Request** template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml`). Include a problem statement, proposed solution, measurable acceptance criteria, and the affected monorepo area(s). All feature requests start with the `needs-triage` label and are scored at the bi-weekly triage meeting using the RICE framework.

See [`docs/issue-triage-and-planning.md`](docs/issue-triage-and-planning.md) for the full triage and planning process.

## 🗂️ Issue Triage and Work Planning

All issues — features, bugs, and docs gaps — follow a consistent lifecycle:

1. Filed with `needs-triage` and at least one area label
2. Scored at the bi-weekly triage meeting (RICE framework)
3. Assigned a priority label and milestone
4. Pulled into a sprint at planning and assigned an owner
5. Closed automatically when the linked PR merges

The complete process, RICE scoring guide, sprint planning rules, and escalation path are documented in [`docs/issue-triage-and-planning.md`](docs/issue-triage-and-planning.md).
